# Chalets and Caviar WordPress Website

My first project with the online learning institute OpenClassrooms involved created a website for a ficticious real estate company, Chalets and Caviar.  The website design was to be implemented using a combination of a Wordpress theme, plugins and custom CSS.  This project served as a great entry way to web development and taught me WordPress can be an efficient and organized way to create a website.  In the files included are my custom CSS, a document explaining my theme choice, and a document explaining how the future administrators of the website are able to alter content.  Thus, in this project I successfully chose a theme, and customized the website using plugins and custom css to suit the desired design of the real estate agency.
